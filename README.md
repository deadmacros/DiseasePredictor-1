# DiseasePredictor-1

DiseasePredictor-1 is a machine learning-powered application designed to predict diseases based on user-input symptoms. The project aims to assist users in identifying potential health conditions quickly and efficiently, leveraging data-driven models and a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Symptom-based Disease Prediction:** Input your symptoms and receive a list of possible diseases.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes trained models for accurate predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Provides information and probability scores for predicted diseases.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip (Python package installer)
- (Optional) Virtual Environment tool (e.g., `venv` or `virtualenv`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/deadmacros/DiseasePredictor-1.git
    cd DiseasePredictor-1
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
